# Workout

Workout is a mobile app that helps me manage my workout routine. The app doesn't provide a specific workout or exercises plan, it's all up to you. Instead, it gives you the ability to completely customize your training day and monitor your progress. In addition, the application provides such features as: managing goals, recording key results, managing your training presets (if you donâ€™t want to spend time planning, just use the preset). If you train on your own, you no longer need to remember everything you have planned for your workout. Just plan whenever the time is right, train when the time comes, and stay focused.

#### Tools:  Typescript, React native, Redux toolkit, Realm
